## Running the Backend

To start the Node.js backend:

1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm i
    ```

2. Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```bash
    cd qna-backend/
    ```

3. Run the server using `ts-node`:
    ```bash
    ts-node src/server.ts
    ```

The backend server will start, and it will be ready to handle API requests.

## Running the Frontend

To start the Next.js frontend:

1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm i
    ```

2. Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd qna-frontend/
    ```

3. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The frontend will launch, and you can access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
